###  Reflection
`2016-03-11-Tao Zhang-thired-post.md`


### Due time for posts:
- __Sunday at 11pm__ on slack channel `#assignments`



### This week’s class reflection:

- I finished two milestones as: Gathering the Data of Atlantic Seafoods Recipes and Searching more information about OTN
- Daqing and Xiaoke found different fishes’ informations about Great white Shark, Atlantic Salmon and Atlantic Bluefin Tuna.
- I posted more information on Github
- I still working on "Design Depth Scroller Page"
- I'm getting used to use Waffle to check and manage the progression of our project.
- I found lots of interesting seafood and traveling web sites as my inspirations.

###  The plan for next week:
-I start doing the layout of scroll web sit with visual graphic and fish images.









- We are using github (a code repository hosting site)
- We have a public project storing everything: [Github](https://github.com/shiftkeylabs/shiftkeylabs.github.com)
- we are using something called `Jekyll` which "magically" turns that repository into a blog hosted [here](http://shiftkeylabs.github.io/)
