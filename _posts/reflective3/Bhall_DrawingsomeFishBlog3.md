##Drawing Some Fish
This week, i unfortunately could not attend class, but i completed the homework of getting design mockups done for our project. Our interactive aquarium will have different characters for each under water species. I researched some fish, and their colours and drew different versions of what the cartoon type fish could look like. I focussed on the target audience being children, therefore i made the faces a bit funny and child like. The colour schemes are bright blues, and whatever colour the fish is, and made their eyes to be the most similar, but their expressions are different based on fish.
