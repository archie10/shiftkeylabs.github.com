## Shift Key Labs
### Seminar 4
After the designing of prototype, next step for building this application is to get familiar with underlying technology. Our group comprises of members from different backgrounds,designing apects of this prototype are being completed by students from NASCAD while members from Compuetr science background work more on technical aspect of this application. We will be using Utility platform for developing this game/application. But few members are not familiar with this tool yet so we are starting with basic tutorials and then segment the further work according to the ability to perform tasks on Utility tool. This game could be developed in 2D scenario or even 3D scenario. Starting from user interface till the connectivity of application to OTN data. With every week we are approaching to our end product which will be integration of design, marketing and technical aspects into it. Utilization and presentation of OTN data to aware mass public will be the final productive goal of this application.
