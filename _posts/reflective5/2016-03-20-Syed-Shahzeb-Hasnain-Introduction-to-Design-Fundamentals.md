# Introduction to Design Fundamentals
Being from the programming and coding background, we dont ususally focus much on design and people are more concerned about design rather than the engine that runs behind it. Design is what is most visible to the end user and unfortunately, we dont have much exposure to its fundamentals in our courses. ShiftKey labs arranged a great session on Design Fundamentals which was hosted by Stephanie Loukes. 

## What did we learn
1. Backgrounds speak alot of anything
2. Font faces and font selection is essential
3. Font styles various in which the text is depicted to the user
4. Context of image( Even a single line !) can be very essential in design.
5. Color describes the way in which an image in interpreted
6. Shapes and layout speak alot about perspective
7. All design integrates into one canvas which can have alot of depth to the meaning of the content.
8. We all saw how we imagine abstract words into design with an interactive session.
9. An awesome " how to toast a bread" activity which showed how we all think almost the same but everyone has his or her unique was of expressing it.
