# Reflective Blog on the Past Week:

​

    Free Pizza at it again.

​


​
Last class was i would say one of the most productive ones. we had a lot of reflecting on the project itself and the approach we are taking to accomplish the task. I am continuing to learn Unity, which is being a challange at the moment but hopefully i'll get it figured in time. The main topic of my Reflective this week is not the class but the Design workshop this past Wednesday. It sharted out a little week but picked up much momentum by the end. By the end of it i was hping for it to be longer actually.

Anyhow, We learnt a lot about design. The workshop provided me with a different view of things than i'm used to. From a designers prospective things sure do look a lot different and challenging. Turning words into visual representations is a Feat. in itself. But i can say one thing for sure, i do like the design perspective of things as it intrigues me.
​


The workshop started out with a slide show presentaton which i belive is a challange for most people to go through. But there it was "Pizza" saving the day, filling life into everyone once again and it got everyone going again. From there on the workshop went pretty steady at the least, i would say.

I'm eagrly hoping to see many more such workshops as not only are they informative but fun too.
