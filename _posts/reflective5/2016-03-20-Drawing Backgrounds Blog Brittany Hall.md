##Drawing Some backgrounds
This week I drew a lot of underwater plants and fish for our aquarium.
I learned about animation and making gifs, this will be useful for creating mockups for future projects. I also helped with creating wireframes for where the design will take place. I also learned about what types of languages that will be used for our project.
