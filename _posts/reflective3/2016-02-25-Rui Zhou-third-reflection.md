## This Week Reflection
In this course, we played a interesting game. Each group give two words, one is a non, and the another one is a objective. After that we switch the words, and our group get ‘socks’ and ‘cheap’. Finally, we should find a problem to be addressed from those two words. This game gives us a way to know how to find user needs and deal with it. It is useful for us to develop our project steps.
