### Reflective

What:
- Every team gave a 5 minutes stand up presentation on what they did on their first week.
- Next Patrick starred giving feedbacks related to github and waffel.io task creation and their work flow. 
- And he also provided individual group feedbacks where they are lacking and how they could over come those issues.
- Finally we started woring for milestone 2 taks and discussion.
