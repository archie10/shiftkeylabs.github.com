## Class Experience
In this class, I got the difference between UI and UX. UI is about the buttons which looks nice and fit the web or app; while, the UX is about the user experience that as a designer I should consider about how to make the interface looks nice and more easer to be use for users.
​
And I also know what I should do is different with other of my group mates during this project, each of us should do something different but useful to create our final work.
