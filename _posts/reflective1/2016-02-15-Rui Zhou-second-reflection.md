##  Class Experience
In this corse, we draw a mind map to organize our final work. It is so helpful for us to make sure what we are going to do, who is our customer, how can we seal data by our project, what is our users’ needs, and so on. From this course, we are really started our project, it became more clear, and it is guide us to do our group work more easer.
It collects all kinds of ideas from different aspects by each of our group mates. 
It is more useful for me to ensure what I will do.
