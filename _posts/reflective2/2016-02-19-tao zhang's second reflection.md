###  Reflection
`2016-03-2-Tao Zhang-second-post.md`


### Due time for posts:
- __Sunday at 11pm__ on slack channel `#assignments`



### This week’s class reflection:

- I start two milestones as: Gathering the Data of Atlantic Seafoods Recipes and Searching more information about OTN
- Daqing and Xiaoke are doing the research of fishes’ informations about Great white Shark, Atlantic Salmon and Atlantic Bluefin Tuna.
- Start using the Github and Waffle, I haven't sure that how to use them.
- I did some arrangements with my team numbers to make sure we on the same step and getting the different jobs to do.
- I'm getting used to use Waffle to check and manage the progression of our project.
- I shared more information with my team numbers about my OTN data research.











- We are using github (a code repository hosting site)
- We have a public project storing everything: [Github](https://github.com/shiftkeylabs/shiftkeylabs.github.com)
- we are using something called `Jekyll` which "magically" turns that repository into a blog hosted [here](http://shiftkeylabs.github.io/)
