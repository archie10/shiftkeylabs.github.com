## Shift Key Labs
### Seminar 3
As we move towards end of this course, the final versions of our prototype could be envisioned. On Monday 29th Feb, we as a team discussed about the various scenarios and prototype model's layers where it could be defined in aspect of OTN data. A design outline of this was formated by individual feedback from every team member. As tean members from NASCAD focused on the design visuals while Dalhousie members shed light over inetrfaces and different scenarios which can have impact on the clients using EcoPet Apllication. I am still working on the scenarios that how pollution would have impact on the aquatic species while other members are working on how water levels and fish population can be used in the design. These scenarios are built to let user know their impact on aquatic life. These scneraios are implemented due to the fact that all users are familiar to these concepts and these provide more visual effects in the essesnce of application. We are hoping that this envision of us we have direct effects on user's awreness and people would be more interested in Aquatic life.
