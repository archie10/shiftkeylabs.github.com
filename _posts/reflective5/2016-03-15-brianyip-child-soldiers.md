# Child Soldiers

Last term, I completed a project that was ongoing for three school terms. Our client was satisfied with my group's deliverable and I got to shoot with CBC and Global news. I was never interviewed on the news or TV before, so this was a new experience for me. Here are the key points:

- Don't get too technical when making a blurb to the general public
- Keep the ideas concise
- Keep a big smile on your face and show lots of interest towards what you are being interviewed for
- Speak clearly
- Preparation goes a long way
- The interviewers will only take the highlights of your interview
