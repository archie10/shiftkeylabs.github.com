# Initial design for the prototype!

The class began with pictching in about the progress that each group has made so far, and where do they stand with respect to the final deliverable.

##### Nomenclature for the project:
After spending like 15 minutes, we came up with three possible names for our interactive aquarium:
* *Tap n' Track Aquarium* 
* *Tap n' Track Tank*
* *Fish Finder*

We created a poll on facebook to vote for the name. And came up with Tap n' Track Aquarium as the name for our interactive aquarium.
Then we decided to have **Tap N' Track** as the name for the project.

##### Prototype Design:

Then we started with assigning various tasks to different team members and decided on what issues need to be finished this week. The focus was on the animating the fish,
creating bubbles in the background for the aquarium. And layering of different animated images together using css. The other tasks included, animating the fish,
finding a map which contains the migration cycle for the fish, 

##### Discussions:

In the latter part of the class, we all spent time working on github and figuring out the best possible way to have further issues for the next milestone,
the tasks were then formulated and assigned to different team members.
