# Reflective Blog on the Last class :

​

    So it begins.!

​


​
I walsked into the last class wondering what will it all be about and guess what? We are finally moving head on towards the project. I have never been very fond of programming and probably never will be, but i started trying to learn unity for game designing and all i can say at this point is. it has got my interest. going through the tutorials learning new things. I must say my team really looks motivated and everyone enjoys doing what they are doing. 
​


currently we are looking at the ui aspect of the game we are making with a lot of research. There are lots of things to go through and the time looks short but i do believe we can manage to do it...I hope... In the class we got a chance to hear about every teams progress and the approach they are taking towards accomplishing the tasks. Every thing looks well and good in theory and all that stands ahead is weather or not it can be done in the end. 

For me, I'm learning new things everyday. making my way slowly and steadily towards where i want to go and working my way towards the outcome i am hoping for.
