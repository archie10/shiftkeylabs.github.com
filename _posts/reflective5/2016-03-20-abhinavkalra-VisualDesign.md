# Fundamentals of Design

#### Need for an effective visual design
Picture conveys a thousand words. Visual design elements of any item such as website, poster or a product are important in establishing its appeal and also for the ease of its usability by a person. The workshop on Fundamentals of Design by Stefanie Loukes held this week in Shift Key Labs elaborated a lot of these aspects of design.
#### Aspects of design
There are several elements which contribute towards making an effective or visually appealing design. The most predominant amongst these include Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity. Contrast differentiates various elements on the screen and is thus used to provide emphasis on one element over the other. Alignment governs the position of the elements on the layout. Proximity is a method of grouping related elements together and thus providing a sense of cohesion. Repetition underscores the importance of a particular element and the message we wish to convey. 

Various types of fonts and the associated font families are used after taking a great care in how visually appealing they make our product, the degree of ease with which it can be read and the overall theme of the design. For example, Serif or Sans Serif fonts are much more legible as compared to the Script font families. 

Grids on the other hand neatly organize and proportion our layout and help us to arrange the different elements. A cluttered design is often difficult to read and follow. Several other elements that contribute towards the design include color palette, randomness or even level of transparency.
#### My take away from the workshop
The workshop made me realize that there are several of these elements which are often used in designing of a website, poster or a product which we just take for granted. A lot of careful thought and understanding goes into choosing a particular design element. What the user sees and how simple and fluid we can make their interaction with our product is as important as the coding that has gone in the background. The two activities wherein we had to draw a workflow and associate an image with a word were very engaging. Overall it was a really informative and fun workshop.
