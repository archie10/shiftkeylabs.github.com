### Due time for posts:
- __Sunday at 11pm__ on slack channel `#assignments`


### Reflection On Project Management With Waffle: 

- Ecopet decided to break down our deliverables and set up 4 milestones for our project. We aligned tasks with skills as much as possible. 
- This week we focussed on early feedback on the team by building a “paper Prototype”. This entailed working on the the user experience people would have with our product. 
- After stargazing potential ways users would interact with the app we walked them through the process with visual aids. 
- Each team member was responsible to either help design the “paper prototype” or work further on the user experience of the app. 
- Each member was responsible to record insights and feedback from potential customers/ users about what they thought of the process and the mission of our product. 
- Waffle was useful in visualizing our teams progress in reaching our first milestone.
