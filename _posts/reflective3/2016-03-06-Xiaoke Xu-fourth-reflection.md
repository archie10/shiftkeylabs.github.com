#### This week's class reflection:
- This week we set up the first two milestones and we need to fininsh the first milestone in this week.
- Everyone has different works. Daqing Cao and me should each find three different fishes' informations. For example, the fishes' images, type, size, food. The fishes must live or exist near the Halifax's coast and we will find these informations in OTN.

#### The workshop's reflection:
- On this week's thursday evening, I attended the Bluemix platform workshop. 
- The platform is easy to use but it is not such easy to learn how to use it. 
- Firstly, it introduces what IBM does in Canada. Then, uses almost three hours to teach how to use bluemix platform. I think this platform is fun, because support lots of programming languages and lots of techniques. We also built a chat app with the platform. The graphical programming is interesting, I will keep learning it.
