# Workshop #3 Building Great Presentation Skills

### Presentation by Scott Furlotte and Ashley Power
topics covered and key points:
- start with the why
  - few people know why they do what they do
  - some people know how they do it
  - everyone knows what they do
- think from the inside out, start with the big picture then break it down into pieces (this was demonstrated with a partner jigsaw game, where one person had to describe how pieces fit together to the other person who was putting the pieces together blindly)
- tell a story 
- our brains are lazy and resist new ideas without resonating a story
- make your voice vary in pitch, pace, and volume
- put 10 minutes of prepping into minute of  ex. for a 30 min presentation spend 5 hours preparing (300 minutes)
