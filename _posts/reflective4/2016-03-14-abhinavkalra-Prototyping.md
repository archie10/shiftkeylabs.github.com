# Importance of Prototyping

#### Why should we prototype
Even before we start to design an application or a product, we must have a way to know if the premise of our application is actually feasible and that we may be able to realistically design what we hope to accomplish. Prototyping offers a smart way to understand how the product might look and how users might interact with it.

A prototype is basically an initial version of the final product. It provides insight into the functionality and the design that we might hope to integrate into it. Furthermore, it serves as a first step to evaluate the user interaction with the product. We can nitpick over how the further iterations of the design might change depending on the feedback we receive from the initial evaluations.

#### Ways to prototype
Story boarding is a great and fun way to show how the product will be presented, the flow and navigation through various steps of user interaction. Low fidelity prototypes on the other hand may have limited interaction abilities but are good for testing how a user will interact with the application and validate our product. These usually incorporate an initial design view but help to greatly refine the further versions of the design. 

#### Conclusion
There are several prototyping tools available in the market such as Moqups, Invision or SkaleView with which we can rapidly design our prototypes. While such an activity might consume time at the beginning of the design phase, rich set of information can be obtained from validating our products at an early stage and avoid blunders and reworking our design approach at a later date. Consequently, prototyping should be incorporated as an essential part of a UX Design strategy.
