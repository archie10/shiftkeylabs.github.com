# How it is to be done!
##### Assigning tasks:

With this weeks class there was a sharp turn with how things were going so far. It has been a pretty smooth ride with no bumps yet,
 but now we need to tighten our seat belts for the road ahead. The first thing that happened was, we were asked to divide the entire project into a set of issues and then assign these issues to various team members.
 

##### The Issues and Waffle.io:

The next part was having a look at the waffle.io page, waffle is a ***GitHub*** powered tool used to track for teams and open source. The issus goes through four possible stages:
1. Backlog,
2. Ready,
3. In Progress and,
4. Done

The person who is assigned the issue can drag the issue through the above mentioned stages, the done stage means the task has been completed
The tool also has a metrics option which displays the data in graphical form, the issues completed successfully and the intended milestones that were to be completed.

##### The Milestones:

The issues were then included as a part of the milestones. The milestone for this week had 2 very important and introductory issues:

* Data for the application and,
* Coding platform selection.

The data collection includes creating an intial database for the type, family, genus etc about the fish. The waffle interface works in collaboration with GitHub so the progress of the task assigned can be seen by all the members.
