### Due time for posts:

#### This week's class reflection:
- In this week's class, our group talks about what each member in our group do last week. We also set up what we should do for this week. Cao and me will think about how we design the structure of our website. The other members will do things like to design the images. It is more harder than I thought to consider about the structure of our website. However, Cao and me will try to conquer it this week.
