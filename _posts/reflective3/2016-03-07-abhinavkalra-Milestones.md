# Divide and Conquer

#### Identify targets
An essential component to getting any task accomplished is to first broadly classify the various subtasks that need to be accomplished. These serve as the target that have to be completed in order to achieve the overall goal. We do this by breaking down the task into various smaller acivities which serve as targets or milestones for the team to accomplish. 

#### Establish milestones
We then breakup the overall time at hand to complete our goal and allocate these various targets for completion during a specific time period. This serve as the milestones for the team. These milestones can be defined on a day to day, week to week basis and so forth. It is essential that at several phases during these milestones, the team sits together and assess what has been done until now and what remains to be achieved to accomplish that milestone. This helps in tracking the degree of completion of the task and ironing out bottleneck if any.
##### Assigning responsibilities
The team sits together and breaks down the broad categories of tasks to be performed for a particular milestone in to various subtasks that can be assigned to the team member. Each person keeps track of the assigned task through various tracking and collaboration tools such as Github and Waffle.


Thus we see that following such a divide and conquer strategy to any project can ensure timely completion of tasks and prevent any open issues form cascading further.
