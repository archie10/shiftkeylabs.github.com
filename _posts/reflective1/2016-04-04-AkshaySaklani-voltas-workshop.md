## My experience in Game Jam
This week I went to the Voltas Game Jam. I have been to workshops and I expected this to be a workshop where someone will teach you a skill, but this event turned out to be different. I registered for the Game Jam and when I arrived at the event, everyone was trying to know each other, where they from and what they are specialized in. I was interested in developing games and used flash or advanced java to create games but was not an experienced game developer.
I met many new people and talked about career opportunities related to game developing in Halifax. I then joined a group consists of three people, Matt, who is a programmer at Longtail studios, Yan Lee, she is a consultant at an Employment company and Liam, who recently finished high school and is working as a game tester for a gaming company. Other groups were already formed way before the event got started. The topic of the game was ritual. We have to create a game idea that involves ritual. 
The first day we brainstorm ideas, starting with the meaning of ritual and started naming different rituals. Then we started picking up terms and forming new ideas for the game, filling each otherâ€™s blanks.  Just when we structured a game idea, Liam showed us the game called Rituals that has the same plot. So we start over again. 
Matt showed me how to work in Unity. I have not have heard about Unity application before this event but I had the basic knowledge of C# and JavaScript and in a day or two I learned a lot from Matt how to create games in Unity. Liam showed me the games his company is working on. One of them was a multiplayer strategy game similar to popular Clash of Clans. 
We could not design a game in the given time slot but I had a great learning experience. The games presented by other groups were very well designed.
