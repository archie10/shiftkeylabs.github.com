# Tap N' Track

### This week and next

What was done this week:

- the name for our interactive aquarium was chosen "Tap n' Track" based on group and class feedback
- I created a logo for our project
- I started to create a background for the fish to swim on and then passed it to Britt to finish
- I animated one of the sea creatures and passed it along to the computer science members of the group to see if they would be able to input the gif. into tap n' track
- the other memebers of the group were working on putting together a prototype for the next time we met
- all design elements should be completed now

What will be done next week:

- we will work out this kinks of the programming
- we will have a presentation started
