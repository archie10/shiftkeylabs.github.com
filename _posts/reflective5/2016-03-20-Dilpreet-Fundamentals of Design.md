# 2016-03-20-Dilpreet- Fundamentals of Design
## Shift Key Labs
### Seminar 5


Interesting workshop for Coders last week on 16th March, it was the basic fundamentals of design we need to incorporate to enchance the product we develop. These were just basic design aspects which can change whole outlook of the product when implemented, therefore basic but essential. Word 'Basic' i use in this case is because it was as simple as your fonts, titees, colors, backgrounds etc. Just by using these aspects product could be transformed into more attractive and qualtiy product.

Workshop started with discussion of design principles- Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, Proximity. These become basis for creating fonts, titles, colors, relationships, backgrounds. Each module in this workhop defines itslef independetly but yet connected to every other design module. It illustrated that how designer's decisions effect even a small design module. Selection and creation of design should directly reflect the motive of the product as well as should attract its users or clients. A small game was played where each member of audience was asked to deign how they would make a toast, at end results were gathered and displayed on white board.  Then discussion was about how effective should be the design of making toast; it should be short, simple and convey the message directly. Too many steps involving making a toast will not be good in quality while too less number of steps will not convey the message of your design. Then there was another activity where we had to make design for particular word like team work, qualty etc. It allows a person to think in completly different way, design can be divded into sub-parts and then could be integrated together to form a final product. This workshop came in at right time when we are still into the dsigning of prototype Ecopet, i would try to implement these basic scenarios of design into our prototype.
