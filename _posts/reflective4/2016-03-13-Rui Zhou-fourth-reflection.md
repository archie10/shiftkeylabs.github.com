## This Week’s Reflection
This week we create some milestones to start our project. This is the first step of research part. Tao and me should search some good recipe for fish that comes from the OTN data. 
During our in class discussion, we decided to search some image firstly, and then connect it with Cao and Lin’s result to chose some repartition fish to create our recipe.
After class, I will make a ‘mockup of fish consumption page’ to show our basic project page.
